              <h3>The Feriocity</h3>
              <p>Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have run out of fuel and collapsed under their own gravity.<br> The gravitational force of a black hole is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it..</p>

            <div class="fact">
              <h3>More</h3>
              <p>Black holes come in different sizes, ranging from small ones that are only a few times more massive than the Sun to supermassive black holes that are billions of times more massive than the Sun. Supermassive black holes are believed to be located at the centers of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way.</p>

                <h3>Event Horizon
                    </h3>
                <p>The event horizon is the point of no return for anything that enters a black hole. Once something crosses the event horizon, it is impossible for it to escape the black hole's gravitational pull.</p>

            <div class="fact">
              <h3>Black Hole Spin</h3>
              <p>Black holes can spin, and their spin can affect the space-time around them. A spinning black hole can create a "frame dragging" effect, which can cause nearby objects to orbit around the black hole in a different way than they would around a non-spinning black hole.</p>
